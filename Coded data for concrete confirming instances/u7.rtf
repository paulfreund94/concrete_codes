If she takes the magazine it's not on the table anymore x\par
If she had said she had taken the magazine to read, then it is off the table. x\par
In this case I would certainly believe that the magazine was off of the table because my coworker told me that she hadn't taken it and at least what was presented in this scenario she did not indicate that she put it back on the table. x\par
The co-worker took the magazine from the table. x\par
Coworker had taken only the book so magazine was only on the table. x\par
She would have taken it off the table when she took it. x\par
She said she took the magazine so I have no reason to think she's lying.\par
I believe that magazine is on the table.\par
"\par
The co-worker told you he picked up the magazine" x\par
Because it was my initial belief\par
If she had taken the magazine it would no longer be on the table.  x\par
both were on the table, but the coworker has removed them x\par
According to what my coworker said the book and magazine are independent of each other. x\par
It's what I was told. x\par
I have no reason to think the magazine is not on the table unless someone told me they moved it. x\par
If she told me she took the magazine to read I would believe it is now off the table.\par
Assuming both were there from the beginning I would assume she got it from the table.\par
The magazine was on the table unless changed. \par
I know the magazine was on the table so if she didn't take it and took the book instead I would believe its still there. If she came and told me she took the magazine instead I would believe that it was now gone from the table. \par
If she took the magazine, then it is no longer on my table because she has it. x\par
in either case the coworker either left or took the magazine x\par
because coworker has confirmed it x\par
I would have no evidence to believe that the magazine was off the table until my coworker specifically told me that it was. x\par
Due to take the magazine from the table x\par
The coworker took the magazine off the table x\par
I have no reason to doubt what my coworker says x\par
coworker has taken the book for reading x\par
If the coworker said she had taken the magazine, it would no longer be on the table. x\par
IF she took the magazine it still wouldn't be on the table, but if she took the book the magazine should still be there x\par
I woukd assume the she was currently using or holding the magazine and did not return it yet x\par
