No one has told me plans have changed. x\par

Bert saying he is excited doesn't change anything about who is coming. x\par
Him being excited doesn't impact anything.\par
I believe that i am going hiking with the two persons. x\par
Anna told you that they both would. \par
I have no reason to think otherwise x\par
Nothing has changed since my original belief and B has reaffirmed my belief. x\par

I have no information to change my view. x\par
No one has told me anything different about not going hike and Bert just confirmed he's excited so I assume everyone is going x\par
No one has told me anything different so I still believe we are all hiking together.x\par
It seem both will still go\par
because they both confirmed\par
Nothing has led me to believe that Anna's plans have changed. x\par
