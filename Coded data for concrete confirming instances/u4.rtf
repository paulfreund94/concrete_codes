\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 x = both situations mean the same thing, n=12\par
"Not the case...off the table" and "ensured both are on the table" mean the same thing x\par
Because you have learned different things from each different situation.\par
In the second scenario I believe something slightly different in that it is possible for one book to remain on the table oh, wow in the first scenario I learned that books books are on the table.  While my belief may be changed in scenario 2, I haven't yet learned the truth so I believe two different things.\par
My sister has confirmed them to be in the state that I thought they were in.\par
She will change the things and keep it at different place may be either on or off the table.\par
Both situations imply that the magazine and book would still be on the table after my sister cleaned. x\par
Not being off and being on are the same thing. x\par
I believe that my sister cleaned and take off the book and magazines.\par
my sister say cleaned the place\par
I believe what she says \par
The final state of both has the book and the magazine on the table. x\par
My sister stated the books are off the table, not on\par
She performed a different task in S1 and S2. In S1 the book and magazine is on the table. In s2 the opposite. Therefore different beliefs. \par
In both situations I'm told both items are on the table.\par
In one scenario I was ensured the items were on the table and in the other it was the opposite.\par
I believe what my sister has said in both situations. x\par
They can't both be off and on the table together.\par
Both situations have the book and magazine being not off the table. \par
They are the same situations just a little different wording but I would take her word that she either removed them or didn't x\par
At first I believe the magazine and book were on the table but then my sister told me they were not on the table.\par
In one they are both on the table but in the second only one is\par
she might removed it and then after making use of it she might put it back\par
Neither the book nor the magazine were moved off the table in either case, so if I believe my sister, then I believe the same things in both cases. x\par
nothing on the table\par
They mean the same thing x\par
In both scenarios I learn that my sister has ensured that the book and magazine are on the table, it just seems like different wording x\par
It is not the case that either the magazine or the book is off the table.\par
Both situations say that both items are on the table after cleaning. x\par
Being on the table and not being off the table are the same things. x\par
I would go by what she said and assume that the book and magazine were on the table x\par
